*This game has audio cues. Headphones are recommended.*

While investigating an abandoned school, the player gets locked inside and has two goals:
1. Exit Safely
2. Collect evidence for his/her report to determine if the school is haunted by spirits

In order to safely exit the school, the player must collect all pieces of evidence, which are scattered throughout the map.

Throughout the game, there are many doors; and the Player can die at each door in one of two ways:
1. If an enemy is behind the door and the player attempts to enter the room
2. The player keeps the door open for too long

While players cannot see an enemy upon opening a door, enemies can be heard. If an enemy is heard, close the door immediately!

There are ```12``` total locations, ```10``` objects, ```6``` NPCs in the game.

The Player has a **level** and **XP** statistic. The level increases by ```1``` each time the XP increases by ```10```.
The Player can earn **XP** from traveling, picking up objects, and talking to NPCs.

*Locations are restricted based on the player's current location or the items in their inventory.*
